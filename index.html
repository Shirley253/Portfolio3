  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="about"
   <p>My love of languages led me to obtain a degree in English Literature
     from the University of Wyoming in 1995. After college
     I became a medical laboratory technician to satisfy my other love, science.
     I attended Clover Park Technical College where I recieved an Associates Degree
     in Medical Laboratory Science. After doing that
     for a number of years, I decided to return to the languages and enrolled in
     Epicodus to become a computer programmer.
